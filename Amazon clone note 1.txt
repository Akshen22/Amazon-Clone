1) Lot's of computers -> using google -> everyone's ip address is captured -> group of ip address is formed

2) Chrome javascript:
Right click -> inspect -> console ->

a) alert("Hello World");
-> gives output: Hello World
b) alert("Hello);
   alert("How are you?");
-> gives output, one by one!

Other way:
Sources -> click: >> -> snippet -> new snippet

3) ctrl l: to clear console

4) As alert gives you an input written inside console, what if you want to take an input from user?
For that, write: prompt("What is your name?")
Output: User needs to write (Akshen)

5) Suppose you made a e-commerce site & wanna change the listed product name, you can do it using console, but what when there's many similar numbers? We cannot look at 1000's of same numbers and change it..
So, will use "var"

a) var rent = 1000 -> saves it..
b) console.log(rent), once we write, we get: -> 1000
c) similarly it does works when you work with prompt but not alert

6) To know the type of data in javascript 
-> typeof("Akshen2208@")
-> typeof(1000)
-> typeof(True)

7) To display all at once:
alert("Hello "+name+", How are you?"+" Here's your rent, Rs."+rent)
-> Hello Akshen, How are you? Here's your rent, Rs.1000

8) Length:
-> name.length -> 6
-> Akshen Dhami.length -> 12
